The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software developers to design, develop, and test software. It breaks down the entire process of software creation into a series of steps or stages, making it easier to manage. Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation of the main stages:

Planning: Understanding what the software needs to do and why it's being created. This involves gathering requirements from users or clients.

Design: Creating a blueprint or plan for how the software will work, including its architecture, user interface, and database structure.

Development: Writing the actual code to build the software.

Testing: Checking the software for bugs or issues and making sure it works as expected.

Deployment: Releasing the software for users to use.

Maintenance: After the software is released, fixing any issues or adding new features over time
