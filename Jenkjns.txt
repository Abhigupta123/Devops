####JNLP (Java Network Launch Protocol) in Jenkins refers to a protocol that allows Jenkins agents (also called nodes or slaves) to connect to the Jenkins master for running jobs.

In Jenkins, there are two main ways to set up agents:

SSH agents: These agents connect to the Jenkins master using SSH.
JNLP agents: These agents connect to the Jenkins master using the JNLP protocol.
How JNLP works in Jenkins:
JNLP is typically used when the agent cannot directly connect to the master via SSH, either due to firewalls, network restrictions, or platform differences.
The Jenkins master generates a .jnlp file, which contains the necessary instructions for an agent to connect back to the master.
The agent then uses this file to establish a communication link over HTTP(S), which can traverse network boundaries more easily than SSH.
