"I developed a web-based ChatGPT clone that allows users to interact with a chatbot powered by OpenAI's language models.

The goal was to facilitate human-like AI conversations within a web application

I chose React.js to build the user interface because of its component-based architecture, which makes it easier to maintain, update, and scale

I designed and implemented a user-friendly interface that included a chat window, message input, and response display. React components were used to manage the flow of messages and update the UI dynamically as users interacted with the chatbot."

I integrated the OpenAI API for natural language processing, enabling the chatbot to generate human-like responses. The API was responsible for receiving user queries, processing them, and returning appropriate responses."

OpenAI's API uses Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, which are trained on vast amounts of text data. These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive.

The API allows developers to integrate these models into their applications for various language-related tasks by sending text prompts and receiving responses generated by the model.

I also built a simple backend using Node.js to securely handle API calls to OpenAI. The backend managed authentication, API keys, and helped scale the app to handle multiple users simultaneously."

I optimized the query-response flow by minimizing the number of API calls and handling errors gracefully
